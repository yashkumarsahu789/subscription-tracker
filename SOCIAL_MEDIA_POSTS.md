Indians waste ₹500-1000/month on:

- Unused premium features

That's ₹6,000-12,000 a year 😱

Time to track. Time to save.

### Post 4: Feature Highlight #2
```
Getting paid this month? Don't forget:
- Netflix on 15th
- Spotify on 20th
- Adobe on 25th
- Gym on 5th next month

Our app sends you paid reminders so your wallet doesn't shock you 📢

```

### Post 5: Value Proposition
```
Me: Using 15 different subscriptions across USD/EUR/INR

Phone: How much do you spend monthly? 🤷‍♂️

Also me: Let me use yet another app to track this...

Solution: One free multi-currency tracker for everything

```

### Post 6: Industry Criticism
```
Paid subscription managers charging $5-10/month for a spreadsheet 💀

We built the same for FREE because money tracking shouldn't cost money

100% private, no ads, no upsell

Save that $10/month. Put it somewhere that matters.

### Post 2: Lessons Learned
```
Just launched our first app. Here's what we learned:

1️⃣ Simple problems = Huge market
Everyone has subscriptions they forgot about. It's not a niche.

2️⃣ Free changes minds
Nobody wants to TRY paid tools. Going free first = 10x more signups.

3️⃣ Dark mode matters
More people asked about dark mode than any feature. Build what users ask for.

4️⃣ Multi-currency = Instant audience
One feature: Instant relevance for digital nomads and remote workers.

Building Subscription Tracker has been fun. Looking for feedback 👂

### Post 3: Industry Insight

Did you know?

The average software developer pays ₹3000+/month on tools they ALSO have subscriptions for tracking 😅

We built a free tracker because:

→ Your data stays yours

Try it, save some money, tell us what we got wrong.

**Title**: "I built a free tool to track subscriptions after losing ₹5000 to forgotten payments. It's multi-currency and tracks everything."

```
Hi IndianPersonalFinance 👋

I was paying for Netflix, Prime, Skillshare, Adobe, AND a Gym membership I never used. 

Total monthly damage: ₹6,500
Annual waste: ₹78,000 😱

So I built a free tracker:
✓ Add all subscriptions in one place
✓ Get payment reminders
✓ Track across currencies (USD/EUR/INR)
✓ Pause/Resume anytime
✓ 100% private - no ads, no tracking

It's completely free because money tracking shouldn't cost money.

[Link to app]

I'd love feedback - what am I missing? What would actually make you use this?

Also: Totally expecting to see "just use Excel" comments 😅 But we made it prettier, I promise.

First week goal: 100 signups

Long term: Help Indians save money

Metrics so far:
